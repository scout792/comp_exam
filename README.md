# COVID-19 Impacts on Air Quality
## Predicting $NO_2$ Air Concentrations using Meteorological Data

This code repository supports the analysis of $NO_2$ concentration modeling using a combination of $NO_2$ sensor data and weather data. 

The weather data and $NO_2$ data needed for the code are packaged as separate zip files to ensure the files are smaller than the maximum allowable file size for GitHub.

The Jupyter notebooks are intended to be run sequentially.
